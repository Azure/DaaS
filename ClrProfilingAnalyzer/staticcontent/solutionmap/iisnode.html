<b>iisnode</b> is a native IIS module that allows hosting of node.js applications in IIS. A request would spend time in this module if the underlying node application is taking a long time to execute the request. 
<br /><br/>To troubleshoot the slowness, you have to debug the underlying application based on the type of the application by looking at the relevant logs or other diagnostics.
