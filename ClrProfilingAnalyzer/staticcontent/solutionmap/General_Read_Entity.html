The request spent most of the time in reading the request entity body from the client. This can occur in the following cases:

<ol>
    <li>The client is posting a very large request to the server. Check the <strong>cs-bytes</strong> property of this request, which represents the size of the request content, to understand if that's the case</li>
    <li>The Client is behind a slow network (for e.g. a mobile client) or in a different geography or geo-location </li>
    <li>There is network latency between the client and this application</li>
</ol>
